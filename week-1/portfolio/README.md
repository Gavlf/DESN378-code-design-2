<h1>Token System</h1>

My token system includes all my light mode and dark mode colors as well two typography scales for my heading font Outfit and my body font Inter.

<h1>Design Choices</h1>
. Chose to make the light mode theme blend in with my hero image.
. Put theme switcher in footer so it does not stick out on page. *(Will change when dropdown is created!)
. Did not change stars in contact section for light mode as they are animated. *(Will edit asap)
